### Title: Enhance markdown for Interest: Add links for easier navigation

It would be useful to include clickable links in the daily interest markdown files (e.g., 20260228-interest.md) to allow users to easily navigate to related content or references. This can improve usability and provide a better experience for readers.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. Add hyperlinks for mentioned topics, projects, or resources in daily markdown files.
2. Propose a consistent format for adding these links.
3. Test the links to ensure they lead to the correct destinations.

**Benefits:**
- Easier navigation within the repository or external sources.
- Improved information accessibility.
